<h3>1.  What Information Does Hestia Metrics Surveys Collect</h3> 


<p>When you respond to a Hestia Metrics Survey, we collect information relating to you and your use of our services from a variety of sources. These are listed below. The sections afterward describe what we do with this information.</p>

<p>Information we collect directly from you</p>

<p>Survey data. We store your survey data (questions and responses).</p>

<p>Other data you intentionally share. We may collect your personal information or data if you submit it to us in other contexts. For example, if you provide us with a testimonial, or participate in contest.</p>


<p>Usage data. We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our services. This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on. Additionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses.</p>

<p>Device data. We collect data from the device and application you use to access our services, such as your IP address and browser type. We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.</p>

<p>Referral data. If you arrive at a Hestia Metrics website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.
</p>

<p>Information from third parties. We may collect your personal information or data from third parties if you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us. </p>

<p>Information from page tags. We use third party tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as web beacons) to collect aggregated and anonymized data about visitors to our websites. This data includes usage and user statistics.</p>

<p>Your email address. If a survey creator uses an email invitation collector to send you a survey invitation email, we collect your email address when the survey creator provides it to us. </p>

<p>Providing survey responses is voluntary. Remember, you can always choose not to provide an answer to any given survey question (especially those requesting your personal information or data). However, sometimes this will prevent you from completing a survey if the survey creator has marked that question as requiring an answer.</p>

<h3>2. How does Hestia Metrics use its survey information?</h3>

<p>To create new services, features or content (public data and metadata only). We may use your survey data and survey metadata (that is, data about the characteristics of a survey) for our internal purposes to create and provide new services, features or content. In relation to survey metadata, we may look at statistics like response rates, question and answer word counts, and the average number of questions in a survey and publish interesting observations about these for informational or marketing purposes. When we do this,  survey respondents will NOT be identified or identifiable unless we have obtained their permission.</p>

<p>To contact you for marketing purposes. We will only do this if you have consented to our contacting you for this purpose. For example, during the Survey process we will ask for your permission to use your information to contact you for promotional purposes. You may opt out of these communications at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in them.</p>

<p>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.</p>


<h3>3. With whom do we share or disclose your information?</h3>

<p> We don't sell your survey data, unless you expressly permit us to!</p>

<p>When might we disclose your survey data to third parties? Only for a limited number of reasons. We share your information with our service providers who help us to provide our services to you. We contractually bind these service providers to keep your information confidential and to use it only for the purpose of providing their services.</p>

<p>In rare circumstances, we may share information if required by law, or in a corporate restructuring or acquisition context (see below for more details).</p>

<p>We recognize that you have entrusted us with safeguarding the privacy of your information. Because that trust is very important to us, the only time we will disclose or share your personal information or survey data with a third party is when we have done one of three things, in accordance with applicable law: (a) given you notice, such as in this privacy policy; (b) obtained your express consent, such as through an opt-in checkbox; or (c) de-identified or aggregated the information so that individuals or other entities cannot reasonably be identified by it. Where required by law, we will obtain your express consent prior to disclosing or sharing any personal information. </p>

<p>We may disclose:</p>

<p>Your information to our service providers. We use service providers who help us to provide you with our services. We give relevant persons working for some of these providers access to your information, but only to the extent necessary for them to perform their services for us. We also implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and data is maintained, used only for the provision of their services to us, and handled in accordance with this privacy policy. Examples of service providers include payment processors, hosting services, email service providers, and web traffic analytics tools.</p>

<p>Aggregated or de-identified information to third parties to improve or promote our services. No individuals can reasonably be identified or linked to any part of the information we share with third parties to improve or promote our services.</p>

<p>The presence of a cookie to advertise our services. We may ask advertising networks and exchanges to display ads promoting our services on other websites. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie, but in doing so will not share any other personal information with the advertiser. Our advertising network partners may use cookies and page tags or web beacons to collect certain non-personal information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you with targeted advertising based upon your interests. </p>

<p>Your information if required or permitted by law. We may disclose your information as required or permitted by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or other legal process served on us.</p>

<p>Your information if there's a change in business ownership or structure. If ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, or we undertake a corporate reorganization (including a merger or consolidation) or any other action or transfer between Hestia Metrics entities, you expressly consent to Hestia Metrics transferring your information to the new owner or successor entity so that we can continue providing our services. If required, Hestia Metrics will notify the applicable data protection agency in each jurisdiction of such a transfer in accordance with the notification procedures under applicable data protection laws.</p>

<p>Information you expressly consent to be shared. For example, we may expressly request your permission to provide your contact details to third parties for various purposes, including to allow those third parties to contact you for marketing purposes. (You may later revoke your permission, but if you wish to stop receiving communications from a third party to which we provided your information with your permission, you will need to contact that third party directly.)</p>

<h3>Ownership of Survey Information</h3>

<p>All survey responses submitted to Hestia Metrics become the exclusive property of Hestia Metrics. By submitting a survey response, you hereby irrevocably assign (and agree to assign) to Hestia Metrics, free and clear of any restrictions or encumbrances, all of your rights, title and interest in and to the survey responses submitted. This assignment includes, without limitation, all worldwide copyrights in and to the survey responses, and the right to sue for past and future infringement. By submitting a response to a Hestia Metrics survey you agree to be bound by the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 7001 et seq. (“E-SIGN”).</p>
